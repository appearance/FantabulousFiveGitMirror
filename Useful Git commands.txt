A collection of useful Git commands for the Terminal. Use with caution, it's a scary place.

I changed the gitignore to exclude a folder that folder was still showing as new in my working copy.
I ran the following 3 lines in terminal, pressing enter once terminal stops doing loads of things to execute the third line. 
git rm . -r --cached
git add .
git commit -m "fixed untracked files"
